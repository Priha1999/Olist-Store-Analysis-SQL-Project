# Olist-Store-Analysis-SQL-Project
Olist Store Analysis – SQL Project  Used SQL to analyze Olist’s e-commerce data, focusing on order trends, payment methods, delivery times, customer spending in São Paulo, and the impact of shipping days on reviews. Extracted insights to support business decisions and operational efficiency.
In this project, I applied advanced SQL techniques to analyze Olist’s e-commerce data, focusing on key operational metrics and customer insights. Key highlights of the analysis include:

Weekday vs Weekend Order Trends & Payment Methods: Evaluated order patterns and payment types across weekdays and weekends to uncover sales dynamics.
Credit Card Payments with High Review Scores: Analyzed the number of orders with a perfect review score (5) and linked them to credit card payments, offering insights into payment preferences and customer satisfaction.
Delivery Times for Pet Shop Orders: Measured the average delivery time for pet shop products, providing key data for enhancing delivery performance.
Customer Spending in São Paulo: Assessed average price points and payment behavior of customers from São Paulo to understand regional purchasing trends.
Impact of Shipping Times on Reviews: Investigated the correlation between shipping durations and review scores to highlight the influence of delivery speed on customer feedback.
This project highlights my ability to work with large datasets and extract meaningful insights using SQL. Through detailed analysis, I was able to provide recommendations that support data-driven decision-making in e-commerce operations.
